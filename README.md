Stock Price Prediction: 
Machine Learning Project in Python

Machine learning has significant applications in the stock price prediction. 
In this machine learning project, we will be talking about predicting the returns on stocks. 
This is a very complex task and has uncertainties.

We will learn how to predict stock price using the LSTM neural network.
